Another shae is Polygon - it has no kw
and behaves like the rectangle
If u hover on the polygon, u will see 2 dots
Counts and Radius
click d counts and move ur cursor counterclockwise
to increase the number of polygons. This is how u make diffrent shapes


We also have Star
ALT + Star to draw star from the middle as focal point
ALT + SHIFT + Star to draw star and from mddle as focal point
Star has 3 dots: Counts, Radius and Ratio
the radio is the distancs btw d middle poing and the farthest point of the star
reducing the ratio makes the star thinner
- i created sun
make the star thinner and increase the count to 60 - u got a rel bright sun

- i created mercedes logo
create a star
reduce count to 3
make thinner 
make circle from star center (O then draw ALT + SHIFT)
give the circle border and remove the fill


❤️‍🔥04 FRAMES & GROUPS

F kw to draw frame or select pre configured ones

clip Content
use to hide and diplay more contents upon scrool

by default changing the size of the frame from top or 
left adjust the position of the objects in the frame
holding down SHIFT key when dragging the size changes only the frame and not the object in it.

SHIFT + ALT changes the size in all directions

so if u want to change the size of a frame without
the elements in the frame, hold control or command in Mac

Ctrl + Alt + G create a frame arround a selection

Normally when u move an object outside of a frame it will leave the fram and move into the canvas
this takes them off the frame even in export
howvere hold space bar when moving the object out the fram box and 
the object will still be in the frame and also move as far as u want
