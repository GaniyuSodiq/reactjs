FIGMA PRO SECRETS


❤️‍🔥03 SHAPES
DESIGN IS SHAPES AND TEXT PUT INTO A CONTAINER

R for Rectangle
ALT + Rectangle to draw rectangle from the middle as focal point
ALT + SHIFT + Rectangle to draw square and from mddle as focal point

ALT + SHIFT does same to L, for line 
ALT for drawing line left to right
SHIFT for drawing line at 45 degrees 

SHIFT + L for arrow
ALT for drawing arrow left to right
SHIFT for drawing arrow at 45 degrees 


O for Ellipse
ALT + Ellipse to draw Ellipse from the middle as focal point
ALT + SHIFT + Ellipse to draw circle and from mddle as focal point
SHIFT to draw circle


Another shae is Polygon - it has no kw
and behaves like the rectangle
If u hover on the polygon, u will see 2 dots
Counts and Radius
click d counts and move ur cursor counterclockwise
to increase the number of polygons. This is how u make diffrent shapes


We also have Star
ALT + Star to draw star from the middle as focal point
ALT + SHIFT + Star to draw star and from mddle as focal point
Star has 3 dots: Counts, Radius and Ratio
the radio is the distancs btw d middle poing and the farthest point of the star
reducing the ratio makes the star thinner
- i created sun
make the star thinner and increase the count to 60 - u got a rel bright sun

- i created mercedes logo
create a star
reduce count to 3
make thinner 
make circle from star center (O then draw ALT + SHIFT)
give the circle border and remove the fill


❤️‍🔥04 FRAMES & GROUPS

F kw to draw frame or select pre configured ones

clip Content
use to hide and diplay more contents upon scrool

by default changing the size of the frame from top or 
left adjust the position of the objects in the frame
holding down SHIFT key when dragging the size changes only the frame and not the object in it.

SHIFT + ALT changes the size in all directions

so if u want to change the size of a frame without
the elements in the frame, hold control or command in Mac

Ctrl + Alt + G create a frame arround a selection

Normally when u move an object outside of a frame it will leave the fram and move into the canvas
this takes them off the frame even in export
howvere hold space bar when moving the object out the fram box and 
the object will still be in the frame and also move as far as u want



❤️‍🔥04 FRAMES SIZES FOR WEBSITES AND APPS

for IOS apps, you will generally use 375 X 812
most people are using iphone of this range and for people using bigger screen,
it is easier to scale upward rather than scaling down, thats y we use soemthing smaller

for Android, you should use 360 X 640 0r 360 X 800
the height doesnt reallt matter. what matters is the width which is 360

for tablet devices, you should use 768 X 1024 which is for iPad mini
this is the size that is usually used as tablet breakpoints when writing code

for desktop, you will use 1440 X 1024 bcs that is the most size used for website 
you can increse the height bcs u can scroll up and down
you can also increase the width if u want to scroll left and right horizontally

another screen to use is the 1920 X 1080 for TV or Apple desktops
but it is better to use 1440 for dextop bcs u can scale up from there
if we keep proportion and divide the size by 3 from the size section in Figma
we will get 640 X 360, it is the size of the small android screen - wide ratio
u can use this to design mobile apps like netflix for phone 
apps that use wider screen on screen
