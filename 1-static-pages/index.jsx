// to setup the most basic react app,
// you need to do 2 things

// 1- create a root
// 2- render some markup to the root

// to create a root, 
// i need to import a method called root from the react DOM library from a sub module called reactClient
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"

// we then use the method to create a root
// what we need to pass to the createRoot method is the dom node in our index.html
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

// why is it called 'root'
// since we are going to be rendering all of our markup using react in our javascript files,
// we need one central location where react can insert all of that content
// the div with the id of root that we setup in index.html, 
// will be the root of our application
// it is the one place where react will insert everything
// what we need to pass to the createRoot method is the dom node in our index.html

// now that we have root in our js, 
// i can call a method on that root, a method called render
// and pass in what looks alot like normal html
root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>)

// CHALLENGE - rewrite the first 3 react code we have above this sentence

// import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client"
// const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
// root.render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)

// you might see a similar way in the wild. which is the same thing.

// import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)


// CHALLENGE - setup a react app from scratch
// this time, try rendering an un-ordered list with 2-3 list items
// with why you are excited to learn rwact

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"
const root1 = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
root1.render(
    <ol>
        <li>To create React NAtive</li>
        <li>Build SaaS business</li>
        <li>Build brand online</li>
    </ol>
)
