// to setup the most basic react app,
// you need to do 2 things

// 1- create a root
// 2- render some markup to the root

// to create a root, 
// i need to import a method called root from the react DOM library from a sub module called reactClient
// import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"

// we then use the method to create a root
// what we need to pass to the createRoot method is the dom node in our index.html
// const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

// why is it called 'root'
// since we are going to be rendering all of our markup using react in our javascript files,
// we need one central location where react can insert all of that content
// the div with the id of root that we setup in index.html, 
// will be the root of our application
// it is the one place where react will insert everything
// what we need to pass to the createRoot method is the dom node in our index.html

// now that we have root in our js, 
// i can call a method on that root, a method called render
// and pass in what looks alot like normal html
// root.render(<h1>Hello, React!</h1>)

// CHALLENGE - rewrite the first 3 react code we have above this sentence

// import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client"
// const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
// root.render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)

// you might see a similar way in the wild. which is the same thing.

// import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)

//‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• HOW TO SETUP REACT PROJECT LOCALLY USING VITE
// Vite - fast in french
// you need to have Node and NPM setup
// NPM mostly comes with node so I installed node from the official webpage - .exe
// then i used 'npm create vite@latest'
// give the project a name, selected the framwork and the variant.
// cd into the project name. run 'npm install'
// next is to run run the Dev server. we can do that in VScode
// code . to open the current folder in vscode
// once i am in vscode, i can run 'npm run dev' - my vscode gave error, i had to run it in bash
// run this in powershell admin 'Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned' it fix the error
// this will spin up a dev server on port  http://localhost:5173/
// i just need to go to the address to see the project created with vite

/**
    JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES/FRAMEWORKS 

    LIBRARY is a collection of reuseable code
    reduxes the need to write repetitive/complex things from scratch
    you control how wehn it is used
    no/few boundaries

    FRAMEWORK is predetermined architecture - you follow a specified pettern of development
    you work within the boundaries set by the framework
    there is "Right" and "wrong" way to use the framework

    REACT is considered to be a library

    * when u are buiding small projects
    * when network load is a problem in users location

/**
    React.createElement()

    import {createRoot} from "react-dom/client"
    const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
    root.render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)

    it might be a little bit starnge to have our html inside our javascript
    yes, when react was first introduced, html in js didnt exist

    react exported a function called createElement, similar to document.createElement() in vanilla js
    import {createElement} from "react"
    it takes in 3 parameters

    1- what type of html element you want to create
    2- props
    3- what is the children of the html element. the content in the tag

    so it looks like this
    root.render(
        reactElement("h1", null, "this is an h1 content")
    )

    we can the save the createElement fn inside a variable and use the variable name in .render()

    const reactElement = createElement("h1", null, "this is an h1 content")
    root.render(
        reactElement
    )

    if you console.log(reactElement), 
    {$$typeof: Symbol(react.transitional.element), type: 'h1', key: null, props: {‚Ä¶}, _owner: null,¬†‚Ä¶}
    you will see that is an object that has info
    about the DOM node that is going to be inserted by react into our actual DOM

    this object is just a regular js object
    it needs to be structured the way it is so that react can undertsnad what it is

    it is just a javascript object

    Maybe the react team figured this way of writing html isnt so cool

    but this led to jsx 

    root.render(<h4>Wowo</h4>)

    root1.render(
        <ol>
            <li>To create React NAtive</li>
            <li>Build SaaS business</li>
            <li>Build brand online</li>
        </ol>
    )

    basically having html in javascript
 */

/**
    // ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• JSX

    as you can see, using createElement is not the greatest experince.
    createElement even gets crazier when you have html elements inside each other
    so this difficulty quickly gave birth to JSX

    const reactElement = <h1><span>Hello ReactJS</span></h1>
    root.render(
        reactElement
    )

    under the hood, react is going to turn the jsx into the createElement() call we saw earlier
    JSX is a syntactic sugar on top of the createElement()

    the computer says just tell me what needs to happen and i will worry about how to do it.

    Imperative: how should it be done
    the computer says describe to me every step on how to do something and i will do it.

    in imperative, we have to tell the computer what to do every single step
    like the code below

// with static images that aren't going to be changing or coming froma CDN or database,

// in vanilla js html img is called like like this: <img src = "assets/react.svg">
// bcs the code file is in the same location as the assets folder
// it is somehow different here and it can be a challenge in reactjs, 
// a quick fix is to use absolute path like in the .render()
// <img src="src/assets/react.svg"></img>

// JSX expression must have one parent element.
